## üìñ About The Project

This project is a clone of the famous mobile game Flappy Bird. The main goal was to practice and solidify foundational knowledge in game development with the Godot Engine, including:

* Character physics (gravity and impulses).
* Procedural generation for obstacles (the pipes).
* Game state management (start, play, game over).
* Deploying a finished product to a web platform.

---

## ‚ú® Features

* **Classic Gameplay:** "Tap-to-flap" mechanics to navigate through obstacles.
* **Endless Challenge:** Procedurally generated pipes make every run unique.
* **Score Tracking:** The game keeps track of how many pipes you successfully pass.
* **Responsive Design:** The UI and gameplay are coded to be adaptive to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on the web.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Godot Engine (v4.x):** The core game engine used to build the entire project.
* **GDScript:** The programming language used for all game logic.

## üß† What I Learned

Through this project, I had the opportunity to learn and apply several important skills:

* **Godot Fundamentals:** Gained practical experience with Godot's Scene/Node system, Signals, and Timers.
* **Adaptive & Responsive Programming:** Learned how to write code (`get_viewport_rect()`) and structure scenes (`CanvasLayer`) to handle various resolutions and aspect ratios‚Äîa common challenge in web development.
* **End-to-End Development Workflow:** Practiced the full process from concept and coding to debugging and finally deploying a polished product to a public platform like itch.io.
